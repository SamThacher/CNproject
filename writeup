For milestone 2 we had to add onto our neighbor discovery capabilities from Project 1 by adding packet flooding and implementing the Dijkstra algorithm so the nodes can find the shortest paths between themselves. We created new packets that could handle sending neighbor Tables and added routing tables to our table data types. We also had to figure out how to broadcast the packets correctly and interface between the different types of tables. We decided to update our routing tables (flood) every time a change was made to the neighbor table rather than doing it periodically. We had the most problems with our Dijkstra algorithm, which is still not totally done. Our biggest problem with it was getting the neighbor table of the particular node you are looking at in the min heap. We had trouble getting those neighbor packets and traversing them... also we have no experience with min heaps which we tried to use in our implementation. The code for the dijkstra table is commented out in the final version so the rest of it will run.
